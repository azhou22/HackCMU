The colorful Thai Crunch Salad is a textural delight, featuring spinach, kale, teriyaki chicken, red cabbage, mandarin oranges, chow mein noodles, cucumber, scallions, and sesame ginger dressing. The Caprese Burrata Salad combines the show's star, creamy burrata with savory, herbaceous flavor from ingredients like roasted red pepper, shaved parm, and red pesto vinaigrette.

For those who prefer a more hands-on approach, the Build Your Own Salad option allows diners to customize their meal with a choice of one protein, four toppings, one crunch, one extra, and one of the housemade dressings. For just $2 more, you can have your salad served in a freshly baked bread bowl, adding a delicious twist to your meal.

Flatbreads and roll-ups are also available, including the Southwest Chicken Flatbread with Cajun-spiced chicken, ranch, bell pepper, jalapeno, Monterey jack and cheddar blend, crispy tortilla strips, and green onion, and the Philly Cheesesteak Roll-Up with slow-roasted beef, bell peppers, onion, provolone and mozzarella blend, and ranch dipping sauce.",
